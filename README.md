Nix-darwin config for kickstarting a developer-ready mac.
### Note that this is a very early alpha stage project.
> Right now it only includes my personal config (apps and home settings
Comes with a ready zsh config with sane defaults (at least for me right now)
If you are to use this right now, note that one should first change $USER to name of their own home directory in flake.nix
